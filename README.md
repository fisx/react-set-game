[Play!](https://fisx.github.io/react-set-game/)

A simple react implementation of [the set card
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)).

Bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Card svg files generated with
[diagrams](https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/).

Good intro videos to
[react](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcFxgvJJnoc),
[redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7uASng7QpA); the code from
the videos is [here](https://gitlab.com/react-workshop/react-chat/)
